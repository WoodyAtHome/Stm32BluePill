# Stm32BluePill
ZIG example running a blinking LED on a STM32F103C8 Blue Pill (bare metal), Cortex-M3, 64kB Flash, 20 kB RAM

This example based on two other repositories, https://github.com/tralamazza/embedded_zig and https://github.com/markfirmware/zig-vector-table.

I reorganized the code and files only for my own understanding. If you're interested in programming STM32 maybe you better have a look on the other two examples.
